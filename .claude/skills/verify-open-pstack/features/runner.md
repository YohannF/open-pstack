# Runner and provider dispatch

## Sub-features

Strict argument validation, parent/provider routing, external child launch, prompt delivery, output and receipt persistence, and failure reporting; inspect the diff for which branches changed.

## How to get to it (user POV)

Invoke the installed parent workflow (`poteto-mode`, `arena`, or `swarm` as documented by the candidate) in the fresh isolated harness. Have that parent dispatch its documented external-provider lane.

## Driving it with verify-open-pstack

Read the candidate's `pstack-runner --help` and installed mapping through the native skill. Use a run-owned fixture and fresh output/receipt paths. Exercise all changed provider lanes without changing parent routing. Retain the native parent/child transcript, provider receipt, output, and concrete fixture effect. Confirm provider/model/effort/access mode match the requested route and output belongs to this invocation. Exercise changed invalid-input/failure branches as well. Keep direct runner tests in a separately labeled local-CLI artifact, never as the installed-harness result.

## Gotchas

A missing provider or unusable authentication is a failure, not a skip or weaker-model fallback. Do not add implicit timeouts. A model assertion that a child ran is insufficient; inspect the actual receipt and output. Never reuse output from another SHA or run.
